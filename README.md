# deep_learning
This reposity includes my basic understanding of Neural Network algorithm, the forward and the backpropagration algorithm. The examples are from Trask, in this website http://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/ . I learned the principle from him, then implement the code on my own, with more details added.
